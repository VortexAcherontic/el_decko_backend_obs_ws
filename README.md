# El Decko Backend OBS Studio Websocket
OBS Studio websocket based backend for El Decko. 

## Use this backend
In order to use this backend you need to supply the `streamdeck.json` generated by [El Decko Core](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/el_decko_core) with the following settings:  

````
{
  "STREAM_DECK_SERIAL_NUMBER": {
    "brightness": 30,
    "key_config": {
      "0": {
        "backend": "edb_obs_ws",
        "event": "SwitchScene",
        "event_parameters": {"name":"S: Desktop"},
        "image_idle": null,
        "image_pressed": null
      }
    }
  }
}
````

This will configure the very first key to use this plugin (`edb_obs_ws`) and bind the event `SwitchScene` to it.  
The event will receive the parameter map defined by `event_parameters`.  
`name` defines the name of you scene within OBS Studio.
